This repository contains a Stock Price Prediction project that utilizes historical stock price data to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model for predicting future stock prices. The project covers various stages including acquiring data from Yahoo Finance's API; data cleaning, analysis and visualization; and building the LSTM model.

## Introduction
Stock price prediction is a challenging and popular area of financial analysis. This project demonstrates the process of building a predictive model that uses historical stock price data to forecast future price trends. We leverage Yahoo Finance's API to gather historical stock price data, preprocess it for analysis, and create visualizations to better understand the data. Finally, we employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to make future price predictions.

## Acquiring Stock Price Data
This project utilizes Yahoo Finance's API to retrieve historical stock price data. The data is retrieved for a specified stock symbol and time period and saved in a CSV file for further processing.

## Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization
The data_analysis directory contains scripts and notebooks for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The primary steps include handling missing values, calculating key metrics (e.g., moving averages), and generating various plots and charts to visualize trends, volatility, and other patterns in the data.

## LSTM Model for Stock Price Prediction
To evaluate the accuracy of the LSTM model's predictions, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is commonly used. RMSE measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values, providing a sense of how well the model's predictions align with the ground truth.

In this project, after training the LSTM model, the RMSE is calculated on a separate validation set to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data. This provides insights into the model's predictive power and helps in fine-tuning hyperparameters for better performance.

The performance of the LSTM model for stock price prediction is significantly influenced by hyperparameters â€“ parameters set before training that impact the learning process. Tinkering with these hyperparameters can have a substantial effect on the model's predictive capabilities.
